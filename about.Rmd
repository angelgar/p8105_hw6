### About this site

This is the website created for homework 6 of Data Science class. This was created by Angel Garcia de la Garza (ag3914) and Soohyun Kim (sk4382). In this website, we will create a flexdashboard and a Shiny App that creates visualizations of the Instacart order dataset used in this class.

### Introduction

This is assignment 6 from Data Science I. In this assignment we aim to create a dashboard and a Shiny app to visualize the Instacart dataset used in class. You can click on the link on the top to our about page and our flexdashboard. 

### Instacart Data

We used the instacart data from class. This dataset contains 1,384,617 observations of 131,209 users, where each row in a product in an order. We proceeded to clean the names of the dataset and only keep unique observations. 

You can find more information to the Instacart dataset on the Data Science website [here](http://jeffgoldsmith.com/DSI/dataset_instacart.html).
